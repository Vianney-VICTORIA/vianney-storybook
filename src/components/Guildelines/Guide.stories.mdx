## Where to find documentation:

- Here is the last vue github repo from Storybook. I recommend you to install it on your machine a read the code if your are struggle to do somethings:
https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/tree/next/examples/vue-kitchen-sink

- Since Storybook 5.2 there is a new way to write stories by using CSF ( Component Story Format ). You can still use StoryOf() method but I highly recommended you to stick with CSF, it will be the next current way of writing stories:

https://storybook.js.org/docs/formats/component-story-format/ 

- If you need to ask questions to the maintainers you can use their discord channel:

## How to use the addon-docs:

This current project still has some implementation issues du to the version of storybook. We are using the 5.3.15-beta version. Fix will be provided in the next version of storybook

But you can still code isolate Docs for yours stories. Here is some links:
